 * A utility object which organizes the processing of different stream types.

 *
 * Practically, this allows extracting the Tozny and encryption headers from the
 * stream before taking the leftover, splitting it into the correct sized chunks
 * and feeding it to the decryption algorithm. Each of these steps is a different
 * StreamTransformer organized into a chain with `.then()`
